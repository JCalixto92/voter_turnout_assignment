    <h4> The New York State Board of Elections continues to certify election results, but the current data shows a decrease in voter turnout for the 2024 election. </h4>

    <!-- BODY OF STORY GOES HERE - KEEP IT CUTE!-->

    <p>Over 8 million election ballots have been counted in New York for the 2024 election, the number is 600,000 less than the ballots counted for the 2020 election, according to the <a href="https://nyenr.elections.ny.gov/">New York State Board of Elections.</a></p>

        <!-- DON'T FORGET AN EXPERT QUOT -->
    <p>“Largely more people didn't vote,” said Michelle Fine, a Critical Psyhcology professor at the CUNY Graduate Center.</p>

    <p>Fine said the communities interest in topics ranging from working class issues, financial stability, labor, and housing were not addressed by both parties, resulting in a decrease in voter turnout. She calls it, “both parties missing the mark,” including on international topics like Gaza and investment in continued wars.</p>
        <!-- CHART GOES HERE! -->
 
    <p>Some factors to consider as a reason for a higher voter turnout in <a href="https://vote.nyc/sites/default/files/pdf/vote/county_feb20.pdf">2020</a> is the use of mail-in and early voting, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

    <p>“It would be premature to speculate on turnout for the 2024 General Election, as no race in the state has been certified yet,” said Kathleen McGrath, Director of Public Information at the New York State Board of Elections.</p>

    <p>McGrath shared that County Boards have until Nov. 30th to certify their election results and transmit their Statements of Canvass to the State Board. After that process is complete, the State Board of Elections Board of Canvassers must certify the General Election results by Dec. 9th. </p>

    <p>It will be a long time before there is a final count, but until then, there is still a continued trend downwards in voter turnout in the 2024 election in comparison to the 2020 election.</p>
